# Cancer-Tumor-Classification-A-Machine-Learning-Comparative-Study

Short Description:

• Preprocessed data by handling missing values and normalizing the dataset for tumor classification. 

• Machine Learning Models: Implemented Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Fisher’s Linear Discriminant 
Analysis, and Logistic Regression for Benign vs. Malignant tumor classification. 

• Performance Evaluation: Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis to assess the models’ effectiveness, offering insights into their strengths and limitations.
